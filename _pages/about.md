I hold a **PhD in Computer Science** from the Federal University of Bahia (Salvador, Brazil), with a visiting research period at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), United States.  
My research uses **mixed-methods approaches** to study the **human aspects of software engineering**, especially empathy, team dynamics, developers' well-being, and inclusion.  
I bring over 15 years of industry experience as a software engineer and dedicate my efforts to promote inclusion and diversity in tech.
