I have a **PhD in Computer Science** from the Federal University of Bahia (Salvador, Brazil), with a visiting research period at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) (Richmond, United States). Using **mixed-methods approaches**, my research focuses on the **human aspects of software engineering**, particularly empathy, team dynamics, developers' well-being, productivity, and inclusion. I have over 15 years of industry experience as a software engineer, working for a startup company and at large government institutions.

I am dedicated to increasing access to computer science and enjoy teaching outreach courses for underrepresented groups.
