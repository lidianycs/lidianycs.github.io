A Senior Software Engineer and Computer Science researcher working at the intersection of software engineering and human values. With over 15 years of industry experience and a PhD in Computer Science, my research interests include software engineering, human-centered computing, and empirical research.

Pioneer in the empirical study of empathy as a core human factor in software engineering, including its effects on productivity, software quality, developers' well-being, collaboration, and mental health. I have published in leading venues, including _ACM TOSEM_ and _IEEE Software_.

🏆 My research has been recognized with a **Distinguished Paper Award** at the *2023 Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering, Research Track* and a finalist placement for **Best Paper** in the *Industry Track at the 2024 International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS)*.

As a visiting Researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), funded by the competitive CAPES PrInt Fellowship, I collaborated on international studies examining software team practices and collaboration.

I have experience in teaching and outreach, working with students from both traditional Computer Science programs and non-CS backgrounds. I'm a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion in technology, and I'm currently serving as a Community Manager at BRAVAS in Tech.

Currently, I serve as an active reviewer for top-tier software engineering venues, and I'm a member of the program committee for several conferences, contributing to the research community through peer review and service.
